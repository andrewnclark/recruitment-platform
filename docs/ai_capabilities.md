# AI Capabilities

## Overview

The Recruitment Platform leverages artificial intelligence to enhance the recruitment process, making it more efficient for recruiters and hiring managers. The current implementation focuses on CV summarization, with a foundation that allows for future expansion into other AI-powered features.

## Current AI Features

### CV Summarization

The platform uses natural language processing to automatically generate concise summaries of applicant CVs, helping recruiters quickly understand candidate qualifications without reading lengthy documents.

#### Implementation Details

The CV summarization feature is implemented using:

- **Bumblebee**: An Elixir library for working with machine learning models
- **BART Large CNN Model**: A state-of-the-art transformer model specifically fine-tuned for summarization tasks
- **Nx**: A numerical computing library for Elixir that powers the underlying computations

```elixir
defmodule Recruitment.AI.CVSummarizer do
  @moduledoc """
  Service module for summarizing CV/resume content using Bumblebee.
  """
  
  # Implementation details
end
```

#### Key Features

- **On-Demand Processing**: Summaries are generated only when requested by admin users, optimizing resource usage
- **Background Processing**: Resource-intensive summarization tasks run asynchronously via Oban workers
- **Real-Time Updates**: Users receive immediate feedback on summarization progress via Phoenix PubSub
- **Failure Handling**: Robust error handling with retry capabilities for failed summarization attempts

#### User Interface

The CV summary is presented directly within the application details page, allowing recruiters to:

1. Request a summary with a single click
2. See real-time progress updates
3. View the formatted summary with key points highlighted
4. Retry the summarization if needed

## Technical Architecture

### AI Context

The AI functionality is encapsulated in the `Recruitment.AI` context, which provides a clean API for other parts of the application to interact with AI capabilities:

```elixir
# Request CV summarization
{:ok, _job} = Applications.request_cv_summarization(application)
```

### Model Loading and Caching

The system implements efficient model management:

- Models are loaded once at application startup
- Serving runtimes are cached for optimal performance
- Memory usage is carefully managed to prevent resource exhaustion

### Development and Testing Support

For development and testing environments, the system includes:

- A mock implementation that returns predefined summaries
- Configurable timeouts and processing delays to simulate real-world conditions
- Comprehensive test coverage for AI-related functionality

## Future AI Capabilities

The architecture is designed to easily accommodate additional AI features in the future:

### Candidate Matching

Future versions could implement automatic matching between job requirements and candidate qualifications, providing a compatibility score and highlighting key matching points.

### Skill Extraction

AI could automatically extract and categorize skills from CVs, creating standardized skill profiles for better candidate comparison and searching.

### Interview Question Generation

Based on job requirements and candidate CVs, the system could suggest tailored interview questions to help assess candidate suitability.

### Bias Detection

AI tools could help identify potentially biased language in job descriptions and suggest more inclusive alternatives.

## Ethical Considerations

The AI implementation follows these ethical principles:

1. **Human Oversight**: AI tools assist recruiters but don't make decisions autonomously
2. **Transparency**: The system clearly indicates when content is AI-generated
3. **Privacy**: All processing occurs within the application, with no external API calls
4. **Fairness**: Care is taken to minimize potential biases in AI-generated content

## Performance Considerations

The AI features are implemented with performance in mind:

- Background processing prevents UI blocking during intensive computations
- Caching mechanisms reduce redundant processing
- Resource limits prevent system overload during peak usage
- Configurable timeouts ensure system responsiveness
